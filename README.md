Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ * r^2

where r is the radius.

# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

The area of the circle with radius 5 is 78.53982 


This is an epidemiological Triad that explains the interdependence of host, pathogen, and environment in disease occurrence. The Host in this triad is the organism that can become infected. Host factors includes , but not limited to age, genetics, immune status e.t.c. The Pathogen is the biological entity that causes infection and subsequently a disease. Pathogen could include infectivity, virulence or even dose. The Environment includes all external conditions that affect both the pathogen and the host. These factors or conditions can include climate, population density, vector or parasite presence. A vivid example would be Malaria, a disease caused by a pathogen of parasitic origin known as Plasmodium, with the help of a viable environment, the host is susceptible to this infection and often time becomes infected and this could lead to serious health impairment.

Summarily, the epidemiological triad teaches that diseases aren’t just caused by pathogens alone, it emerges when a susceptible host, a viable pathogen and a favorable environment comes together.
