This is an epidemiological Triad that explains the interdependence of host, pathogen, and environment in disease occurrence. The **Host** in this triad is the organism that can become infected. Host factors includes , but not limited to age, genetics, immune status e.t.c. The **Pathogen** is the biological entity that causes infection and subsequently a disease. **Pathogen** could include infectivity, virulence or even dose. The **Environment** includes all external conditions that affect both the pathogen and the host. These factors or conditions can include climate, population density, vector or parasite presence. A vivid example would be Malaria, a disease caused by a pathogen of parasitic origin known as *Plasmodium,* with the help of a viable environment, the host is susceptible to this infection and often time becomes infected and this could lead to serious health impairment.

Summarily, the epidemiological triad teaches that diseases aren't just caused by pathogens alone, it emerges when a susceptible host, a viable pathogen and a favorable environment comes together.

**Sample Size for disease Detection**

![SAMPLE SIZE TABLE](images/ss_table%20(1).png){fig-align="center"}

[**Question 1**]{.underline}

Find the sample size for necessary to detect a disease at or above **5%** prevalence in a herd of **5000** deer. The desired level of confidence is **95%**

***Answer***

Using the table above, it can be deduced that the sample size needed for the above question is **59,** detecting the disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer and at a 95% confidence interval.

**Question 2**

Using the hypergeometric table, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

-   95% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

99% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population.

***Answer***

Let us assume that the value of the large population is 7000; therefore at

-   95% C.I and at 1% prevalence, the sample size requirement would be **293.**
-   99% C.I and at 2% prevalence, the sample size requirement would be **225**

Therefore, we can extrapolate conclusively that at large populations, the hypergeometric calculations is almost the same as the binomial calculation.

**Question 3**

You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

***Answer***

With **0** deer not having antibodies out of **300** sampled in a herd of **4,000** deer, the **95%** upper confidence limit for prevalence is about **\< 1.5%**. Using the hypergeometric approach for a herd of **N = 4,000** and a sample of **n = 300**, the **95% upper bound** on true prevalence is about **\< 1%** ; more precisely, about **\< 0.95%**.

**TICK - TALK : ASSIGNMENT**

**Basics of ticks identification methods**

The identification of Ticks cuts across different methods and varying species. it includes identification of parts such as the mouth, color, presence of scutum and also festoons. Ticks are broadly classified into soft ticks (Argasidae) and Hard Ticks (Ixodidae).

Intrinsically, Ticks are classified based on the following: Life stage \> sex\> Genus \> Specie.

1.  Life stages: Genital Pores ; 6 or 8 legs.
2.  Sex: Conscutum or Alloscutum i.e either male or female.
3.  Genus: Presence of anal groove, either posterior or anterior.
4.  Species: Using a dichotomous key.

More easily identified is the use of another method with the acronym S.A.M

S. Scutum ; patterned or not.

A. Anal groove ; Anterior or Posterior.

M. Mouth parts ; Long or short.

**PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE OF TICKS**

1.  Ticks are of major public health significance because they are vectors of numerous pathogens that cause diseases in humans and animals

2.  They transmit bacteria, viruses, and protozoa responsible for illnesses such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and tick borne encephalitis.

3.  Tick infestations can lead to allergic reactions, localized skin infections, and in severe cases, tick paralysis caused by neurotoxins in their saliva.

4.  Their ability to parasitize many host species promotes the spread of zoonotic illnesses among wildlife, cattle, and humans.

    As a result, effective tick surveillance and control are key components of global public health initiatives for preventing and mitigating tick-borne diseases.

**EXAM 1**

**Question 7**

In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan , resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scaled deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.

**Answer**

In 2015, an outbreak of hemorrhagic septicemia caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida type B resulted in the mass extinction of Saiga antelope in Kazakhstan. *P. multocida*, a normally benign commensal organism in the respiratory tract, became pathogenic when exposed to unique environmental conditions. During the calving season, a combination of high humidity and increased temperatures caused physiological stress and optimal conditions for bacterial development in the antelopes' respiratory systems. The infection caused rapid-onset septicemia, resulting in internal bleeding, organ failure, and almost a total mortality among affected herds in just a few days.

To avoid similar large-scale death occurrences, efforts should include improved disease surveillance of Saiga populations, conscious environmental monitoring (temperature and relative humidity), and rapid veterinarian response systems capable of early infection detection and field diagnostics. Furthermore, reducing habitat fragmentation would let herds to disperse more widely, lowering density dependent disease transmission.

Enhancing ecosystem management and population resilience should be the main goals of more comprehensive conservation plans. This includes incorporating health monitoring into conservation initiatives, safeguarding migration corridors, and increasing genetic diversity through cross population management ; a One Health approach. To make sure that future disease outbreaks or environmental stresses do not drive this critically endangered species closer to extinction, public awareness campaigns, stringent anti-poaching enforcement, and international cooperation across the Saiga's range states are also essential.

**Question 5:**

For Any Transmissible disease, which of the following host states are possible?

1.  Infected but not diseased
2.  Infected and diseased
3.  Not infected but diseased.

For each state, explain your reasoning and support your answer with at least one example from human or wildlife disease systems. If you believe a particular state is not possible, justify why with clear reasoning.

**Answer**

Infected means the host harbors the pathogen or its replicating material whilst diseased means that the host shows physiological impairment/clinical signs (not just exposure).

1.  Infected but not Diseased: This is possible; as many pathogens establish sub-clinical or latent infections in host . A good wildlife example would be the White tailed deer that's infected with the meningeal worm. In the White tailed deer, the infective stage is present in the deer but causes no disease to the host.
2.  Infected and diseased: This is also possible and common. A state whereby the pathogen replication and host responses causes tissue damage, clinical symptoms and sometimes death. A good wildlife example would be the meningeal worm in the bulk elk which inadvertently eats slugs or snails that is infected; worm larvae then travel through the spinal cord and brain. Elk shows abnormal behavior ,clinical symptoms of emaciation and eventually elk dies.
3.  Not Infected but diseased: This state is not possible. However, an exception to this case would be a human disease system of post-infection with polio disease. This occurs from decades of recovering from acute poliomyelitis( infected and diseased phase), but still developing new or worsening weakness, fatigue or pain and cold intolerance.
