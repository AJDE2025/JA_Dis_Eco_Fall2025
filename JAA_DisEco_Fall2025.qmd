The **Host** in this triad is the organism that can become infected. Host factors includes , but not limited to age, genetics, immune status e.t.c. The **Pathogen** is the biological entity that causes infection and subsequently a disease. **Pathogen** could include infectivity, virulence or even dose. The **Environment** includes all external conditions that affect both the pathogen and the host. These factors or conditions can include climate, population density, vector or parasite presence. A vivid example would be Malaria, a disease caused by a pathogen of parasitic origin known as *Plasmodium,* with the help of a viable environment, the host is susceptible to this infection and often time becomes infected and this could lead to serious health impairment.

Summarily, the epidemiological triad teaches that diseases aren't just caused by pathogens alone, it emerges when a susceptible host, a viable pathogen and a favorable environment comes together.

**Sample Size for disease Detection**

![SAMPLE SIZE TABLE](images/ss_table%20(1).png){fig-align="center"}

[**Question 1**]{.underline}

Find the sample size for necessary to detect a disease at or above **5%** prevalence in a herd of **5000** deer. The desired level of confidence is **95%**

***Answer***

Using the table above, it can be deduced that the sample size needed for the above question is **59,** detecting the disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer and at a 95% confidence interval.

**Question 2**

Using the hypergeometric table, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

-   95% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

99% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population.

***Answer***

Let us assume that the value of the large population is 7000; therefore at

-   95% C.I and at 1% prevalence, the sample size requirement would be **293.**
-   99% C.I and at 2% prevalence, the sample size requirement would be **225**

Therefore, we can extrapolate conclusively that at large populations, the hypergeometric calculations is almost the same as the binomial calculation.

**Question 3**

You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

***Answer***

With **0** deer not having antibodies out of **300** sampled in a herd of **4,000** deer, the **95%** upper confidence limit for prevalence is about **\< 1.5%**. Using the hypergeometric approach for a herd of **N = 4,000** and a sample of **n = 300**, the **95% upper bound** on true prevalence is about **\< 1%** ; more precisely, about **\< 0.95%**.

# **TICK - TALK : ASSIGNMENT**

**Basics of ticks identification methods**

The identification of Ticks cuts across different methods and varying species. it includes identification of parts such as the mouth, color, presence of scutum and also festoons. Ticks are broadly classified into soft ticks (Argasidae) and Hard Ticks (Ixodidae).

Intrinsically, Ticks are classified based on the following: Life stage \> sex\> Genus \> Specie.

1.  Life stages: Genital Pores ; 6 or 8 legs.
2.  Sex: Conscutum or Alloscutum i.e either male or female.
3.  Genus: Presence of anal groove, either posterior or anterior.
4.  Species: Using a dichotomous key.

More easily identified is the use of another method with the acronym S.A.M

S. Scutum ; patterned or not.

A. Anal groove ; Anterior or Posterior.

M. Mouth parts ; Long or short.

**PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE OF TICKS**

1.  Ticks are of major public health significance because they are vectors of numerous pathogens that cause diseases in humans and animals

2.  They transmit bacteria, viruses, and protozoa responsible for illnesses such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and tick borne encephalitis.

3.  Tick infestations can lead to allergic reactions, localized skin infections, and in severe cases, tick paralysis caused by neurotoxins in their saliva.

4.  Their ability to parasitize many host species promotes the spread of zoonotic illnesses among wildlife, cattle, and humans.

    As a result, effective tick surveillance and control are key components of global public health initiatives for preventing and mitigating tick-borne diseases.

# **EXAM 1**

**Question 7**

In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan , resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scaled deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.

**Answer**

In 2015, an outbreak of hemorrhagic septicemia caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida type B resulted in the mass extinction of Saiga antelope in Kazakhstan. *P. multocida*, a normally benign commensal organism in the respiratory tract, became pathogenic when exposed to unique environmental conditions. During the calving season, a combination of high humidity and increased temperatures caused physiological stress and optimal conditions for bacterial development in the antelopes' respiratory systems. The infection caused rapid-onset septicemia, resulting in internal bleeding, organ failure, and almost a total mortality among affected herds in just a few days.

To avoid similar large-scale death occurrences, efforts should include improved disease surveillance of Saiga populations, conscious environmental monitoring (temperature and relative humidity), and rapid veterinarian response systems capable of early infection detection and field diagnostics. Furthermore, reducing habitat fragmentation would let herds to disperse more widely, lowering density dependent disease transmission.

Enhancing ecosystem management and population resilience should be the main goals of more comprehensive conservation plans. This includes incorporating health monitoring into conservation initiatives, safeguarding migration corridors, and increasing genetic diversity through cross population management ; a One Health approach. To make sure that future disease outbreaks or environmental stresses do not drive this critically endangered species closer to extinction, public awareness campaigns, stringent anti-poaching enforcement, and international cooperation across the Saiga's range states are also essential.

**Question 5:**

For Any Transmissible disease, which of the following host states are possible?

1.  Infected but not diseased
2.  Infected and diseased
3.  Not infected but diseased.

For each state, explain your reasoning and support your answer with at least one example from human or wildlife disease systems. If you believe a particular state is not possible, justify why with clear reasoning.

**Answer**

Infected means the host harbors the pathogen or its replicating material whilst diseased means that the host shows physiological impairment/clinical signs (not just exposure).

1.  Infected but not Diseased: This is possible; as many pathogens establish sub-clinical or latent infections in host . A good wildlife example would be the White tailed deer that's infected with the meningeal worm. In the White tailed deer, the infective stage is present in the deer but causes no disease to the host.

2.  Infected and diseased: This is also possible and common. A state whereby the pathogen replication and host responses causes tissue damage, clinical symptoms and sometimes death. A good wildlife example would be the meningeal worm in the bulk elk which inadvertently eats slugs or snails that is infected; worm larvae then travel through the spinal cord and brain. Elk shows abnormal behavior ,clinical symptoms of emaciation and eventually elk dies.

3.  Not Infected but diseased: This state is not possible. However, an exception to this case would be a human disease system of post-infection with polio disease. This occurs from decades of recovering from acute poliomyelitis( infected and diseased phase), but still developing new or worsening weakness, fatigue or pain and cold intolerance.

# **WORKSHEET 4: MULTI HOST PATHOGEN SPILLOVER**

**DATE: 10/19/2025**

**TOPIC: MERS-COV**

*Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*

\
1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 Points)

**Answer: Incorrect; MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in dromedary camels and not in humans. Humans are just incidental hosts and do not sustain transmission without continuous reintroduction by camels.**

2.  Camels Serve as the main animal reservoir in MERS-CoV. (2 Points)

    **Answer: Correct; Research from serological and molecular experiments shows that dromedary camels are the primary reservoir host of MERS-CoV and aid spillover in humans.**

3.  Humans are dead end hosts for MRS-CoV (2 Points)

    **Answer: Correct; Humans are dead end hosts for MERS-CoV. Human to human transmission is limited to close contact, or around clinical scenery. Hence, sustained community transmission does not occur and as such humans are epidemiologically dead-end hosts.**

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV Infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

    **Answer: Incorrect; The case fatality rate is \~ 35% and not 65% ; According to WHO and ECDC (European Center For Disease Prevention and Control)**

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 Points)

    **Answer: Incorrect; The epidemic curve shows multiple peaks over time and also consistent with sporadic outbreak over a decade. It is common with zoonotic spillover with limited human to human transmission and a not a single point source outbreak.**

# **WORKSHEET 5: COMMUNITY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK**

**DATE: 11/01/2025**

**TOPIC: MARBURG VIRUS OUTBREAK, RWANDA 2024**

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    **ANSWER**

    According to Fenton and Pedersen's community epidemiology approach, this outbreak is more of a **spillover event** with apparent multihost dynamics than an emerging infectious illness. During cave exposure, the index patient most likely contracted Marburg virus from its natural reservoir, **Egyptian rousette bats.** Transmission to humans occurred occasionally via **cross-species contact** (low between-species transmission, f₁₂ \> 0). However, sustained human to human transmission was limited to healthcare settings through contact with infected fluids (low within-species transmission, f₂₂ \< 1).\
    Thus, whereas secondary infections among healthcare workers represent amplification due to nosocomial exposure, the virus cannot maintain transmission in human populations without frequent reintroduction from the bat reservoir. According to Fenton and Pedersen's continuum, this puts the outbreak in the spillover to apparent multi-host zone, where it is either temporary or reliant on reservoir transmission rather than a self sustaining pandemic in the new host.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

    **ANSWER**

    1.  **Community Settings**

        \(a\) Minimize exposure to reservoir hosts by limiting entry into caverns frequented by bats, controlling ecotourism, and warning people not to eat fruit tainted by bat urine or saliva.

        \(b\) Community Awareness and Surveillance: Promoting early detection by means of swift reporting and culturally appropriate risk communication regarding the identification of Marburg symptoms and the need for proper medical attention.

        \(c\) Environmental Hygiene: Clean contaminated surfaces and if required, employ the separation of impacted homes and niches.

        \(d\) Employing skilled and trained individuals in handling of infected deceased corpse to avoid contact based transmission, viz a viz practicing safe burial practices.

    2.  **Healthcare Settings**

        \(a\) Implementation of strict nursing practices with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). including gowns, glove, respirators and face shields as part of infection prevention control.

        \(b\) Screening of patients for hemorrhagic signs, isolate suspected cases and group confirmed cases in designated locations as part of early triage and isolation.

        \(c\) Using chlorine based solutions in disinfecting surfaces that has been contaminated and disposal of such contaminated objects safely.

        \(d\) Keep an eye on and isolate health care personnel who have been exposed to prevent human to human transmission.

3.Compare Prevalence Between the Two Ponds

\
a. Perform a Fisher’s exact test to compare the two prevalence values.\
b. Report the p-value.\
c. State whether the difference is statistically significant.\
i. If p \< 0.05, the difference is statistically significant

# **WORKSHEET 7: Nipah Virus, Langya Henipavirus & Avian Reovirus**

## **1**

**Nipah Virus**\
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

**ANSWER**

The ecology of the Nipah virus varies greatly between **Bangladesh** and **Malaysia**, resulting in different preventative measures and routes of transmission.

**Malaysia: Transmission**

Fruit bats of the Pteropus genus are home to the extremely contagious zoonotic henipavirus known as Nipah virus (NiV), which is heavily influenced by ecological shifts and human land usage. The transmission pathway in **Malaysia (1998–1999)** was bat → pig → human. Fruit trees planted close to carefully managed pig farms attracted fruit bats, the natural reservoirs. Bats carried viruses into pig cages through their urine, saliva, and partially consumed fruit. Through intimate contact with sick pigs, respiratory secretions, and contaminated fomites on big commercial farms, pigs got infected and acted as amplifier hosts, achieving high viral loads and effectively spreading NiV to people, primarily farmers and slaughterhouse workers. In this context, there was very little human-to-human transmission; the majority of cases were related to farms and occupations.

**Bangladesh: Transmission**

Since there isn't a significant pig sector acting as an amplifier, the ecology and transmission pattern are different in Bangladesh (and areas of eastern India). Rather, direct bat to human transfer and subsequent human to human transmission are the main ways that NiV spillover happens. When fruit bats visit date palm trees, they often lick or urinate into clay collection jars that are used to gather raw date palm sap. People that consume fresh, unboiled date palm sap are exposed to a virus that is spread by bats as a result of this activity. NiV spreads further through close contact with sick people after the initial spillage, particularly in homes and healthcare facilities (caregivers exposed to respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, and contaminated bedding).

The epidemiologic triad (agent, host, and environment) and the global change topics (climate change, deforestation, and changes in farming practices) are supported by these divergent pathways of transmission, which lead to quite diverse preventative approaches in each area. Control efforts in Malaysia concentrate on **managing bridge hosts and biosecurity at the agricultural level:**

1\. Large-scale pig movement management and culling in order to eliminate the amplifier population.\
\
2. Keeping pig pens and orchards apart to prevent pigs and bats from sharing an area.\
\
3. Enhancing waste management, habitat design, and farm cleanliness to lessen bat excrement contamination.\
\
4. Pig workers and slaughterhouse employees should use personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow safe handling procedures.\
\
5. Agricultural zoning adjustments to prevent the co-location of bat feeding places with intense pig production, as well as ongoing observation of pig farms and bats.

Prevention in **Bangladesh** needs to focus on both subsequent person-to-person transmission and bat-to-human spillover via food:

1.  Modifying **date palm sap collection** practices by using **bamboo skirts or physical covers** on collection pots to prevent bats from accessing sap.
2.  Encouraging **boiling or avoiding consumption of raw sap**, especially during high-risk seasons when bats are most active around sap harvest.
3.  Community education on avoiding **partially eaten fruit or foods contaminated by bats**.
4.  Strengthening **infection prevention and control (IPC)** in hospitals and clinics: use of gloves, masks, eye protection, safe handling of secretions, and isolation of suspected NiV patients.
5.  Promoting safer **home caregiving practices**, such as minimizing unprotected contact with body fluids and improving hygiene around sick relatives.

Conclusively, Bat behavior and contact patterns are changing due to climate change and land use changes such as deforestation, rezoning and agricultural development which opens up new forms for both forms of the transmission. In Bangladesh, seasonal rhythms and climatic conditions alter bat feeding behaviour and sap harvest timing, which affects the risk period for food borne transmission; in Malaysia, deforestation and extensive pig farming brought about bats and pigs being in close proximity.

## 2

**Avian Reovirus**\
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

**ANSWER**

There are several ways that Avian Reoviruses (ARV) can propagate, including both horizontal and vertical channels. One of the major ways is through the fecal–oral route, in which infected birds excrete viruses that contaminate litter, equipment, water, and feed, is the main method of horizontal transmission. By consuming or coming into contact with these contaminated materials, birds in the same area can get infected. Additionally, there is vertical transmission, in which ARV is passed from infected breeder hens to their eggs, resulting in congenitally infected chicks. Due to their rapid fecal-oral dissemination, these chicks serve as a "nucleus of infection" for the remainder of the hatch.

ARV transmission is favored by a number of environmental variables. **Polluted feed or water,** **overcrowding, poor litter hygiene, inadequate ventilation, and multiage housing systems are the main causes of transmission.** ARV is still tenacious in the environment, enduring for weeks on surfaces and in litter, particularly in warm or humid environments. Because of its persistence, birds in unsanitized barns are more likely to come into contact with infectious particles.

Key **pathogen characteristics** also support transmission, especially the fecal-oral route. ARV is a **non-enveloped, environmentally stable virus**, highly resilient and able to withstand environmental stressors such as temperature fluctuations, drying, and routine disinfectants. Its durability in organic matter allows it to maintain infectivity in litter and manure, which is why the fecal–oral route is the most efficient and widely observed.

**Viral arthritis/tenosynovitis** in waterfowl, including ducks and geese, is an example of a wild bird disease brought on by ARV. ARV infection causes **lameness, swelling joints,** and reduced mobility in these birds, which hinders their ability to travel, forage, and avoid predators. In addition to lowering overall survival, this also contributes to losses in the fitness and health of the local population.

## **3**

**Langya henipavirus**\
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

**ANSWER**

The recently discovered zoonotic virus known as Langya henipavirus (LayV) was initially found in eastern China. Given that surveillance investigations have shown the largest percentage of LayV-positive samples in numerous species of shrews when compared to other animals, the shrew appears to be the most likely reservoir host. This suggests that **shrews** are the main ecological source of human infections and that they sustain the virus in the wild.

Humans are thought to contract the disease through **spillover from shrews**, most commonly through **indirect contact with settings polluted by shrew feces, urine, or saliva**. Occupational or rural exposure, where individuals often contact with tiny wildlife or their habitats, has been linked to human illness. Crucially, there is no proof of persistent human-to-human transmission; instead, occurrences have been isolated and not frequent.

Since LayV has not shown effective or sustained transmission among humans, does not shown growing case clusters, and has not adapted to human-to-human propagation, it is categorized as a spillover event rather than a possible emerging infectious disease (EID). Without community level amplification, each case seems to be a solitary zoonotic introduction. As a result, although if LayV is noteworthy in terms of surveillance, its epidemiological behavior does not suggest that it will eventually become an EID.

# **CONCLUSION**

Infection with ***B. procyonis*** varies widely, with the highest prevalence in Central and South Asia. Females are more likely to become infected, particularly in high-risk settings. Age differences exist, but are not statistically significant. Worm burdens are highly aggregated, making a few number of heavily infected raccoons the primary cause of ambient egg contamination. These patterns highlight important risk gradients for wildlife, domestic animals, and human exposure in endemic areas.

# **WORKSHEET 9**

**1.** In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the  United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of *Salmonella*? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

**ANSWER**

— **HANDLING POULTRY WITHOUT WASHING HANDS AFTERWARD :** Owners of backyard flocks often caressed birds (including chicks and Hen) before eating, cooking, or touching their faces. Contaminated hands can easily transfer salmonella to the mouth, resulting in illness.

— **KEEPING OF POULTRY IN HOUSES, PARTICULALRY IN LIVING SPACES :** Fecal contamination spread to floors, worktops, and other surfaces when birds or outdoor equipment (feed containers, waterers, bedding) were brought inside. Salmonella exposure in households increased significantly as a result.

— **USE OF POULTRY AS PETS :** Many poultry owners see the broiler chicks as pets that the cuddle, caress and sometimes kiss. Bacterial occurrence often occur through these unsafe practices thereby leading to infection. When a birds mouth or beak comes in contact with its feets , especially one that contains fecal sample, transmission and infection with salmonella is inevitable.

— **ALLOWING KIDS HANDLE BIRDS UNSUPERVISED :** Children often and frequently put their hands in their mouth or even fail to wash their hands properly , thus increasing the chances of ingesting the bacteria.

conclusively, these practices aids the spread of salmonella as the bacteria is commonly shed in poultry feces and persists in the environment and easily transferred to human mouths , hands and household surfaces.

**2.** Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (*Epichloë coenophiala*) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

a\. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte?

b\. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems?

c\. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

**ANSWER**

**(A)**

**— ENHANCED DROUGHT TOLERANCE AND STRESS RESISTANCE:** Endophyte infection of the tall fescue strengthens the plants ability to withstand heat and water stress, helping it persist during harsh environmental conditions.

— **IMPROVED PERSISTENCE AND REGROWTH:** Tall fescue infected with endophyte has rapid regrowth and is quite tolerant to overgrazing. These advantages allows the forage to maintain strong stands even under heavy grazing pressure and poor management.

— **PROTECTION AGAINST HERBIVORY (BIOTIC STRESS):** The endophyte produces an ergot alkaloids that causes toxicosis. However, these same alkaloids acts as natural defense reducing insect feeding and grazing pressure and this allows tall fescue to survive better than uninfected fescue.

— **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:** With these qualities, i.e improved stress tolerance and herbivore resistance, infected tall fescue can outcompete their other forage species, thus dominating most ecological pastures.

**(B)**

— **TEMPERATURE AND DROUGHT STRESS:** Temperature and drought stress increases alkaloid production. Higher alkaloid levels in plants means greater toxin exposure for grazing livestock raising the risk and severity of toxicosis.

— **SOIL FERTILITY AND MICROBIAL EFFECT:** Soil nutrients and microbial communities affect the expression of endophytes. If the soil conditions promote the activity of the endophytes, the plant produces more ergot alkaloids, increasing toxicosis risk.

— **GRAZING PRACTICES AND MANAGEMENT:** Toxin buildup and illness risk are influenced by management choices such pasture rotation, grazing intensity, and fodder availability. Animals are forced to eat more infected fescue in poorly managed grazing systems, increasing exposure.

— **DISEASE ECOLOGY FRAMEWORK (MULTI TROPIC INTERACTIONS):** Fescue toxicosis behaves like a multitrophic disease system driven by interactions among Host plant (Tall Fescue), Symbiont (Epichloe endophyte), Victim host (Grazing livestock), environment (climate, soil nutrient, grazing pressure). Livestock disease severity is indirectly increased by environmental conditions that enhances the plant endophyte interaction or boost toxin production.

**(C)**

— **HEAT STRESS AND IMPAIRED THERMOREGULATION:** Cattle often show elevated body temperatures, difficulty in dissipating heat and increased susceptibility to heat stress.

— **REDUCED PERFORMANCE AND WEIGHT GAIN:** Fescue toxicosis negatively affects livestock health leading to poor growth, decreased feed efficiency, and reduced overall productivity.

— **VASOCONSTRICTION AND REDUCED CIRCULATION:** Since these alkaloids causes vasoconstriction, cattle sometime show signs of cold extremities, reduced blood flow among other diseases.

# **WORKSHEET 10**

1.  What are the different routes of transmission of the African Swine Fever? What roles do Humans play in the spread of the transmission of ASF.

    **ANSWER**

    **ROUTES OF TRANSMISSION**

— **DIRECT CONTACT WITH PIGS:** Contact with infected domestic pigs and wild boar. Virus is usually shed in saliva, urine , blood, nasal secretions.

—**INDIRECT CONTACT (FOMITES):** This is usually from contaminated boots, equipment, clothing, transport vehicles, bedding and feed. Virus remains stable for long period in organic materials.

—**INGESTION:** This occurs through feeding pigs contaminated pork or pork products. Virus can survive for months in smoked, cured, or dried meat.

—**VECTOR BORNE TRANSMISSION:** This occurs through soft ticks (*Ornithodoros spp*) ; this ticks can maintain and transmit the virus in endemic regions, especially in Africa and some parts of Europe. Biological transmission occurs when ticks feed on pigs.

—**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION:** The Virus persists in soil, carcasses, slurry, and farm environments.

**ROLE OF HUMANS**

Humans contribute to the transmision of African Swine Fever , as they are implicated in its long distance spread through the following ways:

1.  Movement of infected pigs across different regions and countries.

2.  Transportation of contaminated pork products which inevitably introduce the virus into new areas.

3.  Poor farm bio-security; which includes contaminated boots, equipment and clothing.

4.  Improper disposal of carcasses or waste from infected farms.

5.  Swill feeding practices, especially when the food waste and with contaminated pork is fed to pigs.

6.  Travelers carrying infected pork products inadvertently releasing the virus into the environment.

2.  Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression and management of Chlamydia in Koalas.

    **ANSWER**

    ***Chlamydia pecorum*** infections frequently cause conjunctivitis, UTIs, and infertility in koalas. These results are significantly worsened when Koala retrovirus (KoRV) is present.

    **—EFFECTS ON DISEASE SEVERITY**

    Similar to other retroviruses, KoRV weakens the koala immune system. The koala is more vulnerable to bacterial infections such as chlamydia as a result of this immunosuppression. Consequently, co-infected koalas with chlamydia and KoRV frequently experience more severe clinical illness. Compared to koalas infected with chlamydia alone, these koalas have more aggressive urinary tract disease often known as wet bottom, faster progressing ocular infections and greater incidence of reproductive tract pathology.

    — **EFFECTS ON DISEASE PROGRESSION**

    Compared to koalas without KoRV, co-infected koalas exhibit higher chlamydia burdens and more persistent infections. Since their immune system is unable to establish effective control, the disease advances more quickly and frequently becomes chronic. Furthermore, systemic immunological dysregulationis linked to KoRV-A, the endogenous variant of the virus which exacerbates tissue damage and inflammation.

    —**EFFECTS ON MANAGEMENT**

    Treatment and population level management of Chlamydia in Koalas are considerably complicated by KoRV. Antibiotics like doxycycline are less effective in koalas whose immune systems have been lowered by KoRV, and even after medication is finished, these animals have greater rates of occurrence, which lowers treatment success. Since co-infected Koalas frequently require prolonged medical care and continuous supportive therapy, their recuperation times are also significantly higher.

    Additionally, since experimental Chlamydia Vaccines typically work less well in KoRV positive koalas, vaccination attempts are also impacted. Due to the high rates of infertility linked to co-infection, KoRV infection creates significant hurdles for conservation and breeding efforts , thus increasing morbidity and mortality at the population level. Generally, KoRV works as an immunosupressive amplifier of Chlamydia illness, making recovery , treatment and management of afflicted koala populations far more challenging.

3.  Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by *Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola*, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)?

```         
**ANSWER**
```

Snake Fungal Disease (SFD) caused by ***Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola*** threatens many wild snake species. Effective management is due to several ecological , biological and logistical challenges;

**KEY CHALLENGES IN SURVEILLANCE**

—**CRYPTIC NATURE OF SNAKES:** These snakes are often difficult to locate making population level monitoring difficult.

—**LOW DETECTION PROBABILITY:** Sometimes, early infection may show subtle or no visible lesions and to confirm these suspicions, confirmatory diagnosis requieing swabs, biopsies and PCR testing has to be carried out.

—**GEOGRAPHIC RANGE:** The geographic range for surveillance is quite wide and SFD occurs throughout much of north america, requiring significant resources to monitor.

—**INADEQUATE BASELINE DATA:** Since there are inadequate baseline data, especially regarding historical health records for many snake species, it is seemingly difficult to assess long term trends or perhaps incorporate suggestions to alleviate or curb infection through species transmission.

—**SPECIES VARIABILITY:** Another challenge in surveillance is the variability in species, as diffirent specie shows different susceptibility and present diseases differently.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN MANAGEMENT**

—**UNESTABLISHED TRETAMENT METHODS:** In the management of SFD, antifungals usually work in captivity , yet they are impractical in the field. furthermore, releasing of treated snakes into the wild are predisposed to the risk of being reinfected.

—**FUNGUS PERSISTENCE:** In the management of SFD, the fungus ***Ophidiomyces*** survives in the soil, leaf litter, and hibernacula; and this predisposes snakes to infection and reinfection in shared habitats.

—**LIMITED RESOURCES:** Wildlife diseases in reptiles receives less attention and funding for research purposes than mammalian or avian diseases.

—**ECOSYSTEM IMPACTS:** Snakes play critical roles in pest control and trophic dynamics, and the management of disease in one specie might influence predator-prey balance in the ecosystem.

—**CONATINMENT CHALLENGES:** Manaagement of this specie might pose some difficulty as snakes moves across landscapes , making bio-security and containment quite difficult.

—**CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE:** Also, in the management process, warmer and wetter conditions may facilitate fungal growth and transmission.

Conclusively, while management is limited by ecological complexities , the lack of scalable therapies and environmental persistence; surveillance is hampered by detection difficulties and insufficient data.

# **DISEASE ECOLOGY FINAL EXAM**

**December 3, 2025**

**WILD 6200**

**QUESTIONS**

1.  True or False, if false, explain why the statement is incorrect

    \(a\) Per the community epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pendersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within-target species transmission will be termed a spillover.

    **Answer**

    **False;** According to Fenton & Pendersen (2005), spillover occurs when both between species transmission (f~12~) is low and within target specie transmission (f~22~) \~ 0, resulting in transient infections in target host. However, when between species transmission is high and within species transmission is zero, the target host can show infections sustained solely by repeated introduction from the reservoir. Fenton & Pendersen call this apparent multihost dynamics. Conclusively, the right classification would be **Apparent multihost and not spillover.**

    \(b\) A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious.

    **Answer**

    **False;** Vector borne diseases are infectious, but they are not contagious because a cotagion requires direct host to host transmission. Vector transmission often bypasses direct contact , thus, the disease is infectious but not contagious.

    \(c\) The eggs of *Baylisascaris procyonis* can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon.

    **Answer**

    *Baylisascaris procyonis* eggs must embryonate first in the environment for 2-4 weeks before becoming an infectious humans. Eggs excreted immediately are non infective.

    \(d\) A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production.

    **Answer**

    **True;** The endophytic fungus in tall fescue produces ergot alkaloids which causes fescue toxicosis leading to reduced feed intake, lowered weight gain, decreased milk production.

    \(e\) Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile Virus.

    **Answer**

    **True;** Northern cardinals develop high viremia and serve as competent amplifying hosts, contributing disproportionately to the transmission of West Nile Virus, thus making them significant as super spreaders in the avian sector.

2.  List the community based interventions used for preventing drancunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections?

    **Answer**

    **Community based interventions & Life Cycle Interruption.**

    Drancunculiasis, or Guinea worm disease , is transmitted when a person consumes water containing copepods infected with *Drancunculus medinensis* larvae. Community based intervnetions have been central to interrupting the life cycle and driving global case reductions. Each intervention targets a specific stage of the parasites development and transmission, thus preventing new infections and limiting environmental contamination.

    One of the most effective community level strategies has been the promotion of **safe water filtration.** Since infected copepods caary the third larvae stage , simple cloth filters, pipe filters and household filtration devices prevents their ingestion. By pjysically removing the copepods from drinking water, filtration directly blocks the parasite at the point of entry into the human host, stoppig new infections from occurring.

    Similarly, the **chemical treatment of stagnant water bodies with temephos (ABATE)** is used to kill copepods before they can serve as intermediate hosts. This intervention disrupts the parasite at the aquatic stage, ensuring that even if infected individuals contaminate water sources, the transmission cycle cannot continue in the absence of viable copepods. This measure is particularly critical in villages reliant on unsafe surface water.

    Additionally, another essential intervention is **preventing infected individuals from entering water sources,** especially during the period when the worms emerges from the skin. The application of bandages and provision of designated containment buckets ensures that the first larvae stage released from emerging adult worms do not reach the community water sources. This germane step ensures the breaking of the cycle at the point where humans would otherwise contaminate water with infectious stages of the parasite preventing further spread within the community.

    Conclusively, complementing these measures with Health education, which empowers communities to adopt safe water practices consistently. Education campaigns teach individuals on how Drancunculiasis is transmitted and why certain behviours increases the risk. Prevention strategies such as filtration and avoiding unsafe water protect both individuals and broader communities .

In Recent years however, the discovery of **emerging infections in dogs,** particularly in Chad, has required adaptation of eradication strategies. Dogs can become infected through consumption of contaminated water or possibly through ingestion of raw or uncooked fish or fish entrails harboring infected larvae. Asa result, communities have incorporated **tethering infected dogs** to prevent them from entering water bodies and contaminating them. There is also expanded **surveillance of dog infections**, mirroring the monitoring systems long used for human cases. Additionally, **proper disposal or cooking of fish waste,** has become an important preventive measure, as it reduces opportunities for dogs to consume improperly handled fish that might carry infected copepodsor larvae.

Finally, these interventions form an integrated community based strategy that interrupts multiple points in the Guinea worm life cycle. Their Evolution to include dog centered measures highlights the adaptability of eradication programs and the importance of understanding all potential reservoirs. As a result, drancunculiasis remains one of the closest candidates for global eradication, made possible through community engagement and targeted interruption of parasite transmission.

3.  Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main Obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD.

    **Answer**

    Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease affecting cervids such as white tailed deer, elk, and moose, and it remains one of the greatest wildlife management challenges in North America. Effective control has proven difficult due to a combination of biological , ecological , diagnostic and sociopolitical obstacles that allow the disease to persist and spread across landscapes.

    A major challenge and obstacle posed by CWD stems from **the extraordinary environmental persistence of prions,** the infectious proteins responsible for CWD. Once shed into the environment through saliva, fece, urine, or carcass decomposition, prions can remain infectious for years, binding to soil particles and even being taken up by plants. This long term environmental reservoir makes eradication nearly impossible and enables indirect transmission long after infected animals have disappeared from an area.

    CWD is further complicated by its **long incubation period,** often spanning across 18-24 months. During this time, infected animals appear healthy yet actively shed prions. Asymptomatic shedding allows the disease to spread silently across herds, undermining early detection and making management reactive rather than preventive; by the time clinical signs emerge, the infection has usually already disseminated widely.

    Another pertinent barrier is the **absence of effective vaccines or treatments.** Unlike conventional pathogens, prions induce misfolding of host proteins, making them extremely resistant to immune clearance and medical interventions. As a result, management strategies rely mostly entirely on prevention, surveillance and population level interventions rather than individual level care, thus placing heavy demands on wildlife agencies.

    Additionally, accurate diagnosis also presents difficulties. **Current testing methods require lymphoid or brain tissue,** meaning that live animal detection is limited and often requires invasive tissue sampling. Most reliable tests occurs postmortem, which restricts surveillance to hunter harvested or culled animals. This introduces sampling bias and delays detection of emerging hotspots.

    Also, from a behavioural and ecological perspective, **natural deer movement patterns and high population densities** facilitate rapid spread. Deer frequently travel across property lines, state boundaries, and diverse habitats, making containment difficult. Congregation at feeding sites, mineral licks and shared habitats increases contact rates and accelerates transmission both directly and indirectly.

    Conclusively, a critical obstacle lies in **public resistance to management actions.** Strategies such as population reduction , targeted culling, feeding bans, or carcass transport restrictions often face opposition from hunters, landowners and local communities. These measures can be perceived as unnecessary, economically damaging or ethically worrying, even when scientifically justifies. As a result, wildlife agencies should navigate complex social landscapes to implement evidence based policies effectively.

    Summarily, CWD management is hindered by **the biological resilience of prions, the stealth of prolonged incubation, limited diagnostic and therapeutic tools, the ecological realities of deer populations and the sociopolitical challenges of implementing unpopular but necessary interventions.** Together, these factors make CWD one of the most persistent and multifaceted disease threats in North American Wildlife.

5.  A beaver carcass was found at the Gunnison River Whitewater Park, Gunnison, Colorado in October 2025. Samples collected during the postmortem examination were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. The lab reported that the animal was positive for Tularemia.

    a\. Name the etiological agent of this disease. What Subspecies of this agent causes Tularemia in Aquatic animals like beaver?

    **ANSWER**

    The etiological agent is ***Francisella tularensis ;*** Aquatic animals such as beavers are usually infected by the subspecies **holarctica (Type B)**

    b\. What are the different routes of transmission for this agent?

    **ANSWER**

    — Arthropods bites (Ticks, deer flies).

    — Contact with infected carcasses or tissues.

    — Ingestion of contaminated water or food.

    — Inhalation of aerosolized bacteria.

    — Predation or scavenging of infected animals.

    c\. Describe key features/ characteristics of this pathogen in the context of human health/public health.

    **ANSWER**

    Tularemia, caused by ***Francisella tularensis,*** is considered one of the most significant zoonotic bacterial pathogens in public health due to its unusual combination of infectivity, clinical severity and bio-defense implications. Several features make this organism a high priority concern.

    —**Extreme Infectivity (Low Infectious Dose):** One of the defining characteristics of F. tularensis is its exceptionally low infectious dose. Research demonstrates that exposure to a few as 10-50 organisms is sufficient to cause a clinical disease in humans. This extraordinarily high infectivity means that even minimal environmental contamination, aerosolization, or brief contact with infected tissues can result in infection. Such low threshold increases the likelihood of outbreaks and makes containment more challenging, particularly in settings where exposure routes may be difficult to control. e.g wildlife, aerosols, contaminated water.

    **—Range of Severe Clinical Presentations:** Tularemia manifests in several distinct form: **ulceroglandular, pneumonic, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, typhoidal;** depending on the route of infection. The **Ulceroglandular form,** the most common inolves a localized skin ulcer and swollen lymph nodes. The **Pneumonic form,** is the most severe, occuring when ***F. tularensis*** is inhaled; it results in high fever, respiratory distress, chest pain, and can rapidly progress to respiratory failure. The **typhoidal form,** is systemic, presenting with sepsis like symptoms and high mortality if untreated. These clinical presentations illustrtates the pathogens capacity to cause both localized and systemic infections, with the pneumonic and typhoidal forms carrying a particularly high fatality rates. Severe cases as such shows the need for rapid medical intervention.

    **—Need for Prompt Antibiotic Treatment:** Tularemia requires immediate antibiotic therapy, most commonly with streptomycin, doxycycline or ciproflaxin. Untreated cases can progress quickly especially in pneumonic or typhoidal forms, resulting in severe systemic illness or death. Early treatment dramatically lowers mortality , but delays in diagnosis are common because early symptoms mimic other febrile illnesses such as influenza. Additionally, there is no widely available human vaccine, placing the full burden of prevention on early detection, risk reduction and timely treatment.

    **—Tier 1 select Agent Classification:** *F. tularensis* is designated a **Tier 1 Select Agent** because it is highly infectious, easily aerosolized, environmentally stable, and capable of causing severe disease. This classification reflects its historical potential as a bioweapon, its ease of airborne spread, the difficulty of early diagnosis, and the absence of widespread immunity. As a result, the CDC requires strict laboratory handling and enhanced national surveillance due to its significant public health and security risks.

8.   Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ 1 million. A total of 1351 samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above 0.2% prevalence in Georgia’s white tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance.

    **ANSWER**

    Georgia DNR used the hyper geometric distribution to determine that CWD prevalence on the state's deer herd was unlikely to exceed 0.2% based on 1,351 negative samples. While statistically valuable, this approach has limitations when applied to wildlife disease surveillance. An important flaw is that the hypergeometric model assumes **perfect test sensitivity** , yet CWD diagnostics tests which are specifically for the lymph node or brain based assays can miss early or sub clinical cases. It also assumes **random sampling**, but hunter harvested samples are inherently biased towards certain age, sex and geographic groups. CWD often clusters spatially, so failure to sample in or near emerging hot spots can lead to **false confidence in disease absence.** Since wildlife populations are mobile and heterogeneous, hypergeometric calculations may underestimate true disease risks, meaning that the disease could be present but undetected despite large sample sizes. Summarily, while it is mathematically appropriate, the hypergeometric approach does not fully account for biological realities such as uneven prevalence, latent infections, and sampling bias, making it an imperfect tool for high consequence wildlife surveillance decisions.

Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants.

a\. **SARS-CoV-2**

—True Multihost (upper right quadrant); high within H~2~ transmission and high between specie exposure. SARS-CoV-2 spreads efficiently within humans (**high β₂₂**) and also transmits among multiple animal species (mink, deer, cats), indicating **high β₁₂**.

b\. **Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome**

— Spillover (Lower left quadrant); low exposure from H₁ and zero ability of H₂ to sustain infection. Hantaviruses are maintained in rodents, and humans do not transmit the virus onward. Spillover are described as infections that are transient because within specie transmission in H~2~ is absent.

c\. **Langya Henipavirus**

—Apparent Multihost (Lower right quadrant) high spillover into H₂ but no onward spread. Langya repeatedly infects humans from shrews (**high β₁₂**) but shows no evidence of human to human transmission (**low β₂₂**).

d\. **Brucellosis**

—True Multihost (upper right quadrant), same as SARS-CoV-2, indicating a true multihost pathogen. Brucellosis persists independently in multiple maintenance hosts ( cattle, elk, bison).

e\. **West Nile Virus**

— This could be a spillover or an apparent multihost, therefore it could either fit into the lower left quadrant or the lower right quadrant. Humans are **deadend hosts** (β₂₂ = 0), but exposure from birds via mosquitoes is high (**high β₁₂**).

10.  Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm Anisakis simplex. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers.

    ![](images/QUE 10.png)

From the diagram above,

—**DEFINITIVE HOST; MARINE MAMMALS:** In the diagram, the marine animal (e.g Dolphins) is at the top of the life cycle and is labelled as the definitive host because this is where the **adult worms** live in the stomach. Also, **sexual reproduction** occurs here: adult male and female ***Anisakis simplex*** mate and produce eggs. The **eggs are shed** in the feces of the marine animal into the seawater. Summarily, the definitive host is the species in which the parasite reaches maturity, reproduces and releases eggs back into the environment to continue the cycle.

—**INTERMEDIATE HOSTS; CRUSTACEANS:** From the diagram above, the next step shows **eggs hatching into larvae** in the water and being eaten by small crustaceans; these are the intermediate host. The eggs develop into free swimming **L2 larvae** in the water. When the crustaceans ingest these larvae, they develop further into **L3 larvae** inside the crustaceans body. This means an essential **developmental change** happens here: the parasite cannot skip this host stage. An intermediate host is therefore a host in which parasites **undergoes required development** ( egg- L2 - L3), but **does not reach sexual maturity.**

—**PARATENIC HOSTS; FISH AND CEPHALOPODS:** In the diagram above, **larger fish and cephalopods** (like squids) eat infected crustaceans. These are labelled as **paratenic hosts**. When these predators eat the crustaceans, they acquire the L3 larvae. The L3 larvae do not develop further inside the fish of squid, they simply **encyst in the tissues** often in the muscle or visceral walls. Multiple trophic levels of fish can successively pass the L3 larvae along. A paratenic host is a **transport or holding host;** the parasite remains infective (L3 stage), **no major development occurs**, bust since thy are inside the fish or squid, it brings the larvae closer to the definitive hosts which eat these prey.

—**DEAD END HOST ; HUMANS:** In the last past of the diagram, humans are shown as **accidentally ingesting the L3 larvae** when they eat raw or undercooked fish or squid. Humans are labelled as **dead end hosts** because the L3 larvae **penetrate the stomach or intestinal wall,** causing inflammation and severe abdominal pain (anisakiasis). However, in humans, the larvae **cannot develop into adults and cannot reproduce.** There is **no egg production and no onward transmission** from humans back into the marine environment. A dead end host is therefore a host that **can be infected** and **show the disease**, but in which the parasite **cannot complete its life cycle or spread further**.

11. All infected hosts are diseased. comment using appropriate examples

    **ANSWER**

    The statement All infected hosts are diseased is **false** because infection does not always lead to clinical illness. Many hosts carry pathogens **asymptomatically** without showing signs of disease. For example, rodents infected with hantaviruses remain **healthy reservoir hosts**, herpesviruses often establish **latent, symptom free infections**, and many birds carry **West Nile virus** without becoming ill. These examples show that **infection is simply the presence of a pathogen**, whereas **disease requires visible physiological impairment**. Therefore, **infection IS NOT EQUAL TO disease**, especially in reservoir species.

12. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV?

    **ANSWER**

    Using the Herd immunity Formula:

    p= 1- 1/R~0~

p= 1- 1/2.5 = 1-0.4 = 0.6

Therefore, **60%** of the seal population would need to be vaccinated to prevent future epidemic of Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV)

13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples.

    **ANSWER**

    Managing wildlife diseases is inherently difficult due to biological complexity, unpredictable ecology, and human factors. From an **epidemiological triad perspective**; which considers the **host, agent, and environment** ; each component presents unique challenges that complicate control efforts. Many pathogens persist in the environment or circulate among multiple wildlife species, making it difficult to break transmission cycles. Wildlife hosts often mask clinical signs, exhibit wide ranging movement patterns, and are difficult to sample systematically, leading to incomplete or biased surveillance data.

    The **environmental component** of the triad adds further challenges. Environmental persistence; such as prion survival in soil or long lived anthrax spores; extends transmission beyond the lifespan of individual animals and makes eradication nearly impossible. Climatic factors, habitat fragmentation, and human land use also influence pathogen survival and host–pathogen contact rates, creating dynamic and unpredictable disease landscapes.

    The **agent component** poses problems when there are no effective vaccines or treatments, as seen with prion diseases or many viral pathogens. Some agents have long incubation periods or subclinical infections, allowing them to spread unnoticed. Others infect multiple species, creating reservoir hosts that maintain infection even when control measures target only one population.

    Finally, the **host component**, especially wildlife behavior and population structure, makes disease management complex. Wildlife move freely across jurisdictional boundaries, migrate seasonally, and congregate in ways that facilitate transmission. Public resistance to management actions—such as culling, restricting feeding, or limiting movement; further complicates intervention strategies.

    Together, these host,agent and environment interactions create a management landscape where early detection, intervention, and long term control are extremely challenging. Effective wildlife disease management therefore requires **coordinated ecological, social, and policy frameworks** that address all three components of the epidemiological triad simultaneously.
