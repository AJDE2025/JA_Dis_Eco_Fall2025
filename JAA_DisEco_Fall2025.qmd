This is an epidemiological Triad that explains the interdependence of host, pathogen, and environment in disease occurrence. The **Host** in this triad is the organism that can become infected. Host factors includes , but not limited to age, genetics, immune status e.t.c. The **Pathogen** is the biological entity that causes infection and subsequently a disease. **Pathogen** could include infectivity, virulence or even dose. The **Environment** includes all external conditions that affect both the pathogen and the host. These factors or conditions can include climate, population density, vector or parasite presence. A vivid example would be Malaria, a disease caused by a pathogen of parasitic origin known as *Plasmodium,* with the help of a viable environment, the host is susceptible to this infection and often time becomes infected and this could lead to serious health impairment.

Summarily, the epidemiological triad teaches that diseases aren't just caused by pathogens alone, it emerges when a susceptible host, a viable pathogen and a favorable environment comes together.

**Sample Size for disease Detection**

![SAMPLE SIZE TABLE](images/ss_table%20(1).png){fig-align="center"}

[**Question 1**]{.underline}

Find the sample size for necessary to detect a disease at or above **5%** prevalence in a herd of **5000** deer. The desired level of confidence is **95%**

***Answer***

Using the table above, it can be deduced that the sample size needed for the above question is **59,** detecting the disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer and at a 95% confidence interval.

**Question 2**

Using the hypergeometric table, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

-   95% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

99% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population.

***Answer***

Let us assume that the value of the large population is 7000; therefore at

-   95% C.I and at 1% prevalence, the sample size requirement would be **293.**
-   99% C.I and at 2% prevalence, the sample size requirement would be **225**

Therefore, we can extrapolate conclusively that at large populations, the hypergeometric calculations is almost the same as the binomial calculation.

**Question 3**

You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

***Answer***

With **0** deer not having antibodies out of **300** sampled in a herd of **4,000** deer, the **95%** upper confidence limit for prevalence is about **\< 1.5%**. Using the hypergeometric approach for a herd of **N = 4,000** and a sample of **n = 300**, the **95% upper bound** on true prevalence is about **\< 1%** ; more precisely, about **\< 0.95%**.

**TICK - TALK : ASSIGNMENT**

**Basics of ticks identification methods**

The identification of Ticks cuts across different methods and varying species. it includes identification of parts such as the mouth, color, presence of scutum and also festoons. Ticks are broadly classified into soft ticks (Argasidae) and Hard Ticks (Ixodidae).

Intrinsically, Ticks are classified based on the following: Life stage \> sex\> Genus \> Specie.

1.  Life stages: Genital Pores ; 6 or 8 legs.
2.  Sex: Conscutum or Alloscutum i.e either male or female.
3.  Genus: Presence of anal groove, either posterior or anterior.
4.  Species: Using a dichotomous key.

More easily identified is the use of another method with the acronym S.A.M

S. Scutum ; patterned or not.

A. Anal groove ; Anterior or Posterior.

M. Mouth parts ; Long or short.

**PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE OF TICKS**

1.  Ticks are of major public health significance because they are vectors of numerous pathogens that cause diseases in humans and animals

2.  They transmit bacteria, viruses, and protozoa responsible for illnesses such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and tick borne encephalitis.

3.  Tick infestations can lead to allergic reactions, localized skin infections, and in severe cases, tick paralysis caused by neurotoxins in their saliva.

4.  Their ability to parasitize many host species promotes the spread of zoonotic illnesses among wildlife, cattle, and humans.

    As a result, effective tick surveillance and control are key components of global public health initiatives for preventing and mitigating tick-borne diseases.

**EXAM 1**

**Question 7**

In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan , resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scaled deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.

**Answer**

In 2015, an outbreak of hemorrhagic septicemia caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida type B resulted in the mass extinction of Saiga antelope in Kazakhstan. *P. multocida*, a normally benign commensal organism in the respiratory tract, became pathogenic when exposed to unique environmental conditions. During the calving season, a combination of high humidity and increased temperatures caused physiological stress and optimal conditions for bacterial development in the antelopes' respiratory systems. The infection caused rapid-onset septicemia, resulting in internal bleeding, organ failure, and almost a total mortality among affected herds in just a few days.

To avoid similar large-scale death occurrences, efforts should include improved disease surveillance of Saiga populations, conscious environmental monitoring (temperature and relative humidity), and rapid veterinarian response systems capable of early infection detection and field diagnostics. Furthermore, reducing habitat fragmentation would let herds to disperse more widely, lowering density dependent disease transmission.

Enhancing ecosystem management and population resilience should be the main goals of more comprehensive conservation plans. This includes incorporating health monitoring into conservation initiatives, safeguarding migration corridors, and increasing genetic diversity through cross population management ; a One Health approach. To make sure that future disease outbreaks or environmental stresses do not drive this critically endangered species closer to extinction, public awareness campaigns, stringent anti-poaching enforcement, and international cooperation across the Saiga's range states are also essential.

**Question 5:**

For Any Transmissible disease, which of the following host states are possible?

1.  Infected but not diseased
2.  Infected and diseased
3.  Not infected but diseased.

For each state, explain your reasoning and support your answer with at least one example from human or wildlife disease systems. If you believe a particular state is not possible, justify why with clear reasoning.

**Answer**

Infected means the host harbors the pathogen or its replicating material whilst diseased means that the host shows physiological impairment/clinical signs (not just exposure).

1.  Infected but not Diseased: This is possible; as many pathogens establish sub-clinical or latent infections in host . A good wildlife example would be the White tailed deer that's infected with the meningeal worm. In the White tailed deer, the infective stage is present in the deer but causes no disease to the host.
2.  Infected and diseased: This is also possible and common. A state whereby the pathogen replication and host responses causes tissue damage, clinical symptoms and sometimes death. A good wildlife example would be the meningeal worm in the bulk elk which inadvertently eats slugs or snails that is infected; worm larvae then travel through the spinal cord and brain. Elk shows abnormal behavior ,clinical symptoms of emaciation and eventually elk dies.
3.  Not Infected but diseased: This state is not possible. However, an exception to this case would be a human disease system of post-infection with polio disease. This occurs from decades of recovering from acute poliomyelitis( infected and diseased phase), but still developing new or worsening weakness, fatigue or pain and cold intolerance.

**WORKSHEET 4: MULTI HOST PATHOGEN SPILLOVER**

**DATE: 10/19/2025**

**TOPIC: MERS-COV**

*Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*

\
1. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 Points)

**Answer: Incorrect; MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in dromedary camels and not in humans. Humans are just incidental hosts and do not sustain transmission without continuous reintroduction by camels.**

2.  Camels Serve as the main animal reservoir in MERS-CoV. (2 Points)

    **Answer: Correct; Research from serological and molecular experiments shows that dromedary camels are the primary reservoir host of MERS-CoV and aid spillover in humans.**

3.  Humans are dead end hosts for MRS-CoV (2 Points)

    **Answer: Correct; Humans are dead end hosts for MERS-CoV. Human to human transmission is limited to close contact, or around clinical scenery. Hence, sustained community transmission does not occur and as such humans are epidemiologically dead-end hosts.**

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV Infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

    **Answer: Incorrect; The case fatality rate is \~ 35% and not 65% ; According to WHO and ECDC (European Center For Disease Prevention and Control)**

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 Points)

    **Answer: Incorrect; The epidemic curve shows multiple peaks over time and also consistent with sporadic outbreak over a decade. It is common with zoonotic spillover with limited human to human transmission and a not a single point source outbreak.**

**WORKSHEET 5: COMMUNITY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK**

**DATE: 11/01/2025**

**TOPIC: MARBURG VIRUS OUTBREAK, RWANDA 2024**

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    **ANSWER**

    According to Fenton and Pedersen's community epidemiology approach, this outbreak is more of a **spillover event** with apparent multihost dynamics than an emerging infectious illness. During cave exposure, the index patient most likely contracted Marburg virus from its natural reservoir, **Egyptian rousette bats.** Transmission to humans occurred occasionally via **cross-species contact** (low between-species transmission, f₁₂ \> 0). However, sustained human to human transmission was limited to healthcare settings through contact with infected fluids (low within-species transmission, f₂₂ \< 1).\
    Thus, whereas secondary infections among healthcare workers represent amplification due to nosocomial exposure, the virus cannot maintain transmission in human populations without frequent reintroduction from the bat reservoir. According to Fenton and Pedersen's continuum, this puts the outbreak in the spillover to apparent multi-host zone, where it is either temporary or reliant on reservoir transmission rather than a self sustaining pandemic in the new host.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

    **ANSWER**

    1.  **Community Settings**

        \(a\) Minimize exposure to reservoir hosts by limiting entry into caverns frequented by bats, controlling ecotourism, and warning people not to eat fruit tainted by bat urine or saliva.

        \(b\) Community Awareness and Surveillance: Promoting early detection by means of swift reporting and culturally appropriate risk communication regarding the identification of Marburg symptoms and the need for proper medical attention.

        \(c\) Environmental Hygiene: Clean contaminated surfaces and if required, employ the separation of impacted homes and niches.

        \(d\) Employing skilled and trained individuals in handling of infected deceased corpse to avoid contact based transmission, viz a viz practicing safe burial practices.

    2.  **Healthcare Settings**

        \(a\) Implementation of strict nursing practices with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). including gowns, glove, respirators and face shields as part of infection prevention control.

        \(b\) Screening of patients for hemorrhagic signs, isolate suspected cases and group confirmed cases in designated locations as part of early triage and isolation.

        \(c\) Using chlorine based solutions in disinfecting surfaces that has been contaminated and disposal of such contaminated objects safely.

        \(d\) Keep an eye on and isolate health care personnel who have been exposed to prevent human to human transmission.

a.  Use the online tool QPweb to calculate the prevalence of Vertico in each\
    pond.\
b.  Report the prevalence as a percentage (e.g., 0.35 → 35%).

**ANSWER**

Prevalence of Vertico in Pond 1 = 0.300 — **30%**

Prevalence of Vertico in Pond 2 = 0.067— **6.7%**

2\. Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval (CI)\
a. Use QPweb to calculate the 95% CI for each prevalence estimate.\
b. Report the CI values as percentages, rounded meaningfully (e.g., 0.057\
→ 6%).

**ANSWER**

| PONDS  | 95% CI - LOWER   | 95% CI - UPPER    |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| POND 1 | 0.140 — **14%**  | 0.525 — **52.5%** |

3.Compare Prevalence Between the Two Ponds

\
a. Perform a Fisher’s exact test to compare the two prevalence values.\
b. Report the p-value.\
c. State whether the difference is statistically significant.\
i. If p \< 0.05, the difference is statistically significant

![](images/POND%201&%20POND%202.PNG)

Fisher's Exact Test:

Pond 1 : 6 Infected; 14 Uninfected

Pond 2 : 1 Infected; 14 Uninfected

Two sided P value = **0.1987.**

Because **p \> 0.05**, the difference in *Vertico* disease prevalence between pond 1 and pond 2 is **not statistically significant**. Although pond 1 shows a higher apparent prevalence of **(30%)**, and pond 2 with a prevalence of **(6.7%)**, this difference of value could be as a result of sampling chance as opposed to true biological or environmental difference.

**WORKSHEET 7: Nipah Virus, Langya Henipavirus & Avian Reovirus**

## **1**

**Nipah Virus**\
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

**ANSWER**

The ecology of the Nipah virus varies greatly between **Bangladesh** and **Malaysia**, resulting in different preventative measures and routes of transmission.

**Malaysia: Transmission**

Fruit bats of the Pteropus genus are home to the extremely contagious zoonotic henipavirus known as Nipah virus (NiV), which is heavily influenced by ecological shifts and human land usage. The transmission pathway in **Malaysia (1998–1999)** was bat → pig → human. Fruit trees planted close to carefully managed pig farms attracted fruit bats, the natural reservoirs. Bats carried viruses into pig cages through their urine, saliva, and partially consumed fruit. Through intimate contact with sick pigs, respiratory secretions, and contaminated fomites on big commercial farms, pigs got infected and acted as amplifier hosts, achieving high viral loads and effectively spreading NiV to people, primarily farmers and slaughterhouse workers. In this context, there was very little human-to-human transmission; the majority of cases were related to farms and occupations.

**Bangladesh: Transmission**

Since there isn't a significant pig sector acting as an amplifier, the ecology and transmission pattern are different in Bangladesh (and areas of eastern India). Rather, direct bat to human transfer and subsequent human to human transmission are the main ways that NiV spillover happens. When fruit bats visit date palm trees, they often lick or urinate into clay collection jars that are used to gather raw date palm sap. People that consume fresh, unboiled date palm sap are exposed to a virus that is spread by bats as a result of this activity. NiV spreads further through close contact with sick people after the initial spillage, particularly in homes and healthcare facilities (caregivers exposed to respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, and contaminated bedding).

The epidemiologic triad (agent, host, and environment) and the global change topics (climate change, deforestation, and changes in farming practices) are supported by these divergent pathways of transmission, which lead to quite diverse preventative approaches in each area. Control efforts in Malaysia concentrate on **managing bridge hosts and biosecurity at the agricultural level:**

1\. Large-scale pig movement management and culling in order to eliminate the amplifier population.\
\
2. Keeping pig pens and orchards apart to prevent pigs and bats from sharing an area.\
\
3. Enhancing waste management, habitat design, and farm cleanliness to lessen bat excrement contamination.\
\
4. Pig workers and slaughterhouse employees should use personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow safe handling procedures.\
\
5. Agricultural zoning adjustments to prevent the co-location of bat feeding places with intense pig production, as well as ongoing observation of pig farms and bats.

Prevention in **Bangladesh** needs to focus on both subsequent person-to-person transmission and bat-to-human spillover via food:

1.  Modifying **date palm sap collection** practices by using **bamboo skirts or physical covers** on collection pots to prevent bats from accessing sap.
2.  Encouraging **boiling or avoiding consumption of raw sap**, especially during high-risk seasons when bats are most active around sap harvest.
3.  Community education on avoiding **partially eaten fruit or foods contaminated by bats**.
4.  Strengthening **infection prevention and control (IPC)** in hospitals and clinics: use of gloves, masks, eye protection, safe handling of secretions, and isolation of suspected NiV patients.
5.  Promoting safer **home caregiving practices**, such as minimizing unprotected contact with body fluids and improving hygiene around sick relatives.

Conclusively, Bat behavior and contact patterns are changing due to climate change and land use changes such as deforestation, rezoning and agricultural development which opens up new forms for both forms of the transmission. In Bangladesh, seasonal rhythms and climatic conditions alter bat feeding behaviour and sap harvest timing, which affects the risk period for food borne transmission; in Malaysia, deforestation and extensive pig farming brought about bats and pigs being in close proximity.

## 2

**Avian Reovirus**\
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

**ANSWER**

There are several ways that Avian Reoviruses (ARV) can propagate, including both horizontal and vertical channels. One of the major ways is through the fecal–oral route, in which infected birds excrete viruses that contaminate litter, equipment, water, and feed, is the main method of horizontal transmission. By consuming or coming into contact with these contaminated materials, birds in the same area can get infected. Additionally, there is vertical transmission, in which ARV is passed from infected breeder hens to their eggs, resulting in congenitally infected chicks. Due to their rapid fecal-oral dissemination, these chicks serve as a "nucleus of infection" for the remainder of the hatch.

ARV transmission is favored by a number of environmental variables. **Polluted feed or water,** **overcrowding, poor litter hygiene, inadequate ventilation, and multiage housing systems are the main causes of transmission.** ARV is still tenacious in the environment, enduring for weeks on surfaces and in litter, particularly in warm or humid environments. Because of its persistence, birds in unsanitized barns are more likely to come into contact with infectious particles.

Key **pathogen characteristics** also support transmission, especially the fecal-oral route. ARV is a **non-enveloped, environmentally stable virus**, highly resilient and able to withstand environmental stressors such as temperature fluctuations, drying, and routine disinfectants. Its durability in organic matter allows it to maintain infectivity in litter and manure, which is why the fecal–oral route is the most efficient and widely observed.

**Viral arthritis/tenosynovitis** in waterfowl, including ducks and geese, is an example of a wild bird disease brought on by ARV. ARV infection causes **lameness, swelling joints,** and reduced mobility in these birds, which hinders their ability to travel, forage, and avoid predators. In addition to lowering overall survival, this also contributes to losses in the fitness and health of the local population.

## **3**

**Langya henipavirus**\
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

**ANSWER**

The recently discovered zoonotic virus known as Langya henipavirus (LayV) was initially found in eastern China. Given that surveillance investigations have shown the largest percentage of LayV-positive samples in numerous species of shrews when compared to other animals, the shrew appears to be the most likely reservoir host. This suggests that **shrews** are the main ecological source of human infections and that they sustain the virus in the wild.

Humans are thought to contract the disease through **spillover from shrews**, most commonly through **indirect contact with settings polluted by shrew feces, urine, or saliva**. Occupational or rural exposure, where individuals often contact with tiny wildlife or their habitats, has been linked to human illness. Crucially, there is no proof of persistent human-to-human transmission; instead, occurrences have been isolated and not frequent.

Since LayV has not shown effective or sustained transmission among humans, does not shown growing case clusters, and has not adapted to human-to-human propagation, it is categorized as a spillover event rather than a possible emerging infectious disease (EID). Without community level amplification, each case seems to be a solitary zoonotic introduction. As a result, although if LayV is noteworthy in terms of surveillance, its epidemiological behavior does not suggest that it will eventually become an EID.
